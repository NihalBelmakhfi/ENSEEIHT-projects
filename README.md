Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I've developed within an academic framework at ENSEEIHT, my engineering school. Each project showcases the skills and knowledge I've acquired in computer science, high-performance computing, and big data, all pursued with a keen interest in solving complex problems and exploring the possibilities of technology in an academic setting.
